# Puzzle Pieces Segmentation using U-Net
This project was done in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the Computer Vision course lectured by Dr. Richard Klein from the Witwatersrand University.

## About the Puzzle Pieces Segmentation project
The aim of this project is to segment puzzle pieces from an image by training the U-Net model to predict a segmentation mask on the puzzle images. This is a computer vision technique called Semantic Segmentation which classifies each pixel in an image to a predefined class. For this project, we have two classes namely the puzzle and background.
